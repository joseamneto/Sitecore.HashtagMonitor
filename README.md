## Category
xConnect

## Purpose
Identify personas and fire goals based on a twitter HashTag

## Detailed description
The Module automatically tracks all tweets for a specified #hashtag and identify accounts that interacts with it and import them to xDB as Contacts, Interactions and Events. 
This module helps marketers to identify the profile of each user along with their engagement with the #hashtag, 
e.g. if someone tweets on #SCHackthon, his informations are imported into xDB. Later, when he visits the website and fills in a VisitUs Form, then we can match the user to a given persona
and show personalized content.
